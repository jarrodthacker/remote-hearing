The COVID-19 pandemic was, to be sure, a game-changing event that forced courts to rethink every aspect of their operations, and bankruptcy courts — the focus of this book — were by no means immune. “Court Orders and Updates During COVID-19 Pandemic”1 — a listing of official pronouncements on court orders dealing with operations, § 341 hearings, entrance protocols, electronic signatures and the like on the federal court website — tracks the progress of the pandemic’s effects. Bankruptcy courts were forced to alter their procedures to eliminate all face-to-face contact between participants in their cases, and almost immediately, every communication between parties shifted either to telephonic or Zoom-style computer conferencing.2</p><p>As this book arrives, the perspective of a year under this “new normal” is instructive. Indeed, as will become clear from the chapters contributed by sitting bankruptcy judges, business and consumer bankruptcy practitioners, and the chief clerk of one of the busiest bankruptcy courts in the country, the outcomes forced by COVID-19, although challenging to all involved, were not universally negative.</p><p>1 https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/court-website-links/court-orders-and-updates-during-covid19-pandemic#bankruptcy. 2 Zoom is communications technology that provides videotelephony and online chat services through a cloud-based peer-to-peer software platform. It is used for teleconferencing, telecommuting, distance education and social relations. </p><p>“I’m here live; I’m not a cat,” insisted attorney Rod Ponton, in a hearing before Judge Roy Ferguson in the 394th Judicial District Court in Texas in February 2021.</p><p>Many courts have actually become more efficient by eliminating scheduling complications such as travel from the equation — so much so that many predict that some form of remote hearings will remain in place (or at least as an option), even after the hoped-for day when the current pandemic is just a memory.</p><p>Other aspects of remote hearings, though, remain all too vulnerable to human or technical error. Pity attorney Rod Ponton, who achieved internet immortality when his Zoom video presented him with a “cat filter” applied. Even without such foibles, the technology raises other concerns. Are computer-based technologies susceptible to hacking or interference, raising privacy and security issues? Are they too unstable or unreliable? Are they readily available to all participants, such as pro se petitioners? Courts across all circuits continue to wrestle with these and other questions, and as can be surmised from the listing of court orders currently in place across the country (Exhibit F), there is not always agreement about the answers.</p><p>We hope that this brief guide will provide a useful overview to judges, court personnel and legal practitioners as they navigate the unpredictable landscape of remote court hearings.</p></article></section><section><h2>Chapter 1</h2><article id="chapter1"><h3>I. Introduction</h3><p>On March 18, 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our court issued a general order closing its clerk’s office, courtrooms and other facilities to the public. Since then, and as the virus tore through America, we and our colleagues across the country have had to figure out how to remotely manage our caseloads, hearing calendars, chambers staff, judges’ meetings and trials without the personal touch that often feels like the most rewarding aspect of our service.</p><p>In many ways, the professional and personal challenges we faced have proven to be no different than those confronted by millions of other global citizens. We learned about Zoom, bought home exercise equipment, and found ways to entertain, educate and stay connected to our children and grandchildren while trying to stay safe and sane. But bankruptcy courts are uniquely essential to the American economy, and bankruptcy judges must make dozens of decisions each day in order to keep our cases — and the lives and livelihoods they impact — on track. As nimble as we have always been, the pandemic forced us to rethink entirely how we did our jobs, which proved to be no mean feat.</p><By>and large, bankruptcy courts have risen admirably to this occasion. We also have learned some unexpected — even pleasant — lessons, not the least of which is that remote hearings and trials save significant time and money. They also greatly improve access to justice. We offer this judicial perspective in the hope that it will make remote hearings easier for our judicial colleagues and for those who appear before us, whether lawyer or pro se litigant.</By><h3>II. Litigant and Lawyer Technology Training</h3><p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, most courts used some form of remote hearing technology, even if it was as simple using conference call technology in the courtroom to permit telephonic appearances. So by now, everyone should be familiar with and understand how to use a variety of telephonic hearing options. The pandemic, however, changed the game entirely, and forced courts to learn about and implement technology that enabled courts to conduct all forms of hearings and trials remotely. We needed to be able to see and hear witnesses and lawyers; to efficiently manage electronic exhibits; and to ensure the integrity of the court’s official record.</p><There>are many technological options for conducting video hearings: ZoomGov Webinar, Microsoft Teams, Cisco WebEx, Jabber and Blue Jeans represent just a few. Explaining how they work, their similarities and differences, and their respective advantages and disadvantages is beyond the scope of this handbook.</There><p>Regardless of the platform your court uses to conduct remote hearings, proceedings will move much more smoothly if every participant has roughly the same baseline understanding of how the chosen technology works. Our court encourages this training — and provides it for free — to all lawyers and litigants. Hundreds of parties and attorneys have taken advantage of this opportunity.</p><p>Our training module focuses on the use of our chosen remote hearing/trial technology (ZoomGov Webinar) from the court’s perspective: We explain how the court will facilitate the hearing and what the litigants and lawyers need to know in order to participate. This (admittedly selfish) perspective offers several advantages. First, it helps ensure that proceedings run smoothly. We have also found that it makes participants much more comfortable and, come the hearing, able to present their arguments more clearly and effectively than if they had to simultaneously struggle with technology and try to argue a motion. Finally, the training offers the opportunity to explain the unique preferences of the presiding judge (something every good lawyer wants to understand). (A short outline of the topics covered in our court’s training module is included in Exhibit A.)</p><p>Our court also dedicates a page on its website to tips and procedures for video hearings. This information includes instructions for registering for the court-provided training described above, as well as common sense, plain-English advice aimed at making sure hearings run smoothly. For example, we remind litigants to make sure to fully charge whatever device they will be using to participate in the video hearing, to dress appropriately, to make sure they are in a quiet place, to test the audio and video functions of their devices prior to joining the hearing, and to mute their microphones when they are not speaking. We also warn litigants that recording, photographing, rebroadcasting or retransmission of court proceedings is strictly prohibited by the Judicial Conference of the United States. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Utah has published a short information sheet that offers helpful tips for preparing for and participating in video hearings. (We have included a copy as Exhibit B.)        </p><p>Finally, we encourage judges to offer one or two practice sessions with lawyers and litigants prior to a trial or an evidentiary hearing. The judge can participate, but more commonly, the courtroom deputy runs these sessions. The participants can practice “sharing” their screens and retrieving and reviewing particular exhibits, and generally can become more comfortable with the video-hearing technology in a setting that more closely mimics an actual trial than what they would experience during a non-evidentiary hearing or a training session.</p><h3>III. Non-Evidentiary Hearings</h3><p>Not every hearing requires testimony or the introduction of documentary evidence. But even where a hearing will involve nothing more than oral argument, there are many ways judges and chambers staff can improve the efficiency of the video proceedings.</p><h4>A. Pre-Hearing Calendar Management</h4><p>We encourage judges to schedule hearing calendars more frequently, and to reduce the number of matters on each calendar. For example, if no timely opposition has been filed in response to a given motion, the court could enter an order granting it and vacating the hearing. If all parties to a particular contested matter will receive service through CM/ECF, then the order need not even be a paper order; a Docket Text Order — entered directly into CM/ECF — would suffice. Whittling calendars down to matters that truly need oral argument will save time and money, and will improve efficiency.</p><h4>B. Pre-Hearing Information</h4><p>Judges should formulate a protocol for distributing information explaining how the parties can participate in a given hearing. Our court handles this by including such instructions with each hearing calendar, which are posted to the court’s website. An example of these instructions are included as Exhibit C. We suggest that hearing-specific instructions include a Zoom link unique to the given calendar, instructions regarding how each litigant should identify themselves and the matter(s) in which they intend to appear after joining via the Zoom link, instructions for participating without video using the Zoom dial-in feature, a reminder regarding the prohibition against recording court proceedings, and a link to the court’s general video hearing procedures page. Courtroom deputies can also distribute these instructions to litigants via email.</p><p>It is important to note that the video hearing platforms with which we are most familiar work best if all participants connect via the internet and do not attempt to participate by telephone. For example, ZoomGov Webinar has a dial-in feature, but those who dial in only will be able to listen to the hearing; they will not be seen or heard. A different Zoom platform (Zoom Meeting) includes a dial-in feature that allows a party connecting by telephone to be heard, but it is less effective in replicating the courtroom. Whatever the limitations of your court’s chosen video hearing platform, it is critical that you explain such limitations clearly and frequently, so as to avoid last-minute snafus.</p><h4>C. Opening the Virtual Courtroom</h4><p>Once litigants have clicked the link and joined a given calendar, judges should require them to “sign in” by typing their first and last name, along with the name of the case or proceeding in which they are appearing. This will permit the judge and courtroom deputy to easily see who is appearing and in what matter.</p><p>About 15 minutes prior to the scheduled calendar, the courtroom deputy opens the virtual courtroom by logging in as host of the Zoom Webinar. While waiting for the calendar to commence, the attendees will see a “splash screen,” which consists of a single PowerPoint slide. The splash screen reiterates the prohibition on recording the hearings, explains in very general terms the functionality participants will have during the hearing, and instructs litigants to use Zoom’s “raise hand” function when the court calls the matter in which they intend to appear. An example of our court’s splash screen is included as Exhibit D.</p><h4>D. Conducting the Hearing</h4><p>Until the hearing commences, the courtroom deputy admits litigants as “attendees.” Attendees will be able to see and hear the judge and courtroom deputy once the hearing begins, but they will not be visible to others. As the judge or courtroom deputy calls each matter on the calendar, attendees can use Zoom’s “raise hand” function to indicate that they wish to participate in the given matter. Once their matter is called, the judge or courtroom deputy changes them from an attendee to a “panelist,” at which point the judge, courtroom deputy and other participants can see and hear them. Once all panelists have been admitted, the hearing can proceed. After the hearing concludes, the judge or courtroom deputy changes the panelists back to attendees (or the panelists simply click the “Leave Meeting” button to exit the virtual courtroom) and admits the panelists for the next matter to be heard.</p><h3>IV. Evidentiary Hearings or Trials</h3><h4>A. Statutory Authority to Conduct Remote/Video Trials</h4><p>Most judges are familiar with Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), which applies in bankruptcy cases and adversary proceedings pursuant to Rule 9017 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (FRBP). FRCP 43(a) requires a witness’s trial testimony to be taken in open court “unless a federal statute, the Federal Rules of Evidence, [the FRCP], or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court provide otherwise.” “For good cause in compelling circumstances and with appropriate safeguards,” however, “the court may permit testimony in open court by contemporaneous transmission from a different location.” Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, courts have relied on FRCP 43(a) as the statutory basis for convening evidentiary hearings and trials via remote means.</p><h4>B. Conducting a Remote Trial or Evidentiary Hearing</h4><p>By and large, a remote trial proceeds in exactly the same fashion as one conducted in an actual courtroom: opening statements (if appropriate); direct examination of witnesses and introduction of documentary evidence; cross-examination of witnesses; and closing arguments. But the features of a given video-hearing platform (we will continue to focus on Zoom Webinar), the sophistication of the witnesses and lawyers, and a judge’s preferences will dictate tweaks to any given step in a trial. And as with most new experiences, a little planning and forethought will go a long way toward ensuring that the trial proceeds smoothly and with minimal frustration.</p><h5>1. Trial Scheduling Order</h5><p>Most judges in our court have revised their preferred form(s) of trial scheduling orders to include instructions specific to video trials. These include instructions as to how to manage exhibits and witnesses, but they also require the lawyers and litigants to think about and discuss their access to and facility with video-hearing technology and the devices they will use to run it. An example of a trial scheduling order is included as Exhibit E.</p><h5>2. Exhibits</h5><h6>a. Paper vs. Electronic Exhibits</h6><p>While it might seem nonsensical to discuss the use of paper exhibits in a handbook intended for remote hearings and trials, we must remember that not all lawyers and litigants will have the same access to or comfort with technology or electronic devices. For a pro se litigant whose only connection to the internet is a cell phone, it will be impossible to observe the trial and read an exhibit at the same time. In such circumstances, paper exhibits might be the best option, notwithstanding their cumbersome nature.</p><p>We encourage courts to conduct a pre-trial conference several weeks prior to trial. During that conference, the court can determine whether paper exhibits will be required for some or all witnesses. The court can also instruct the parties as to how to mark, distribute and manage exhibits for purposes of the trial, whether in electronic or paper form. Taking control of the management of exhibits early in the litigation will result in a smooth, efficient trial and much less frustration for everyone involved.</p><h6>b. Management of Electronic Exhibits</h6><p>Pre-pandemic, many courts haad been moving away from the use of paper exhibits and had implemented practices and procedures governing the use of electronic exhibits, even while they were still conducting in-person trials. For this reason, as well as the fact that most documentary evidence is produced in electronic format during discovery, the management and presentation of electronic exhibits has proven the least troublesome aspect of managing video trials. But having now had the benefit of a year’s worth of intensive practice, we offer the following tips for ensuring efficient use of electronic exhibits.</p><p>Each exhibit should be submitted as individual .pdf or .xls (Excel) files. The importance of this point cannot be overstated. Individual files — as opposed to one giant file containing all exhibits — helps ensure that individual exhibits can be easily located during and after trial and that all exhibits are properly named.</p><p>Devise and require compliance with a protocol for naming exhibits. Here, consistency yields ease of use. It does not matter what naming convention you choose; what matters is that you choose one that: (a) permits you and your staff to identify what party introduced the exhibit (e.g., Plaintiff/Defendant; Movant/Respondent; Debtor/ Bank, etc.); (b) enables you and your staff to differentiate one exhibit from another (by assigning each exhibit a sequential number or letter); and (c) you apply consistently and require the parties to follow. One example of a simple but effective naming convention is P_Ex_1, P_Ex_2 ... and D_Ex_A, D_Ex_B....</p><p>Each exhibit should consist of no more than a single document. Few things will cause a video trial to bog down more quickly than a lawyer scrolling through a 150-page exhibit that consists of every email their client ever received from the opposing party, looking for one message in particular. While it is certainly appropriate for an exhibit to include the entirety of an email thread devoted to a particular subject, for example, or a single contract with all of its exhibits, courts should instruct the parties to include no more than a single document or email thread in each exhibit.</p><p>Require bookmarks for large exhibits. Where an exhibit consists of a large document, such as, for example a credit agreement with multiple exhibits, courts should require the proponent of the exhibit to incorporate electronic “bookmarks” in the document so that each part of it can be located with ease. If the proponent will be focusing on relevant sections or clauses, those can be bookmarked, too.</p><p>Take care to preserve the official record. The court has a duty to maintain and preserve the official record of any trial or evidentiary hearing. Where that official record consists in part of electronic exhibits, the court must take care to ensure that such exhibits are submitted and maintained via means that ensures their integrity. The best way to do this is to require their submission via thumb drive, CD or email. Which method depends on how many exhibits will be introduced and the size of each .pdf file. Shared online directories, such as Google Drive or DropBox, do not work, because any third party with access to the relevant account can modify their content.</p><p>Screen-sharing only works in small doses. Screen-sharing is a tool that allows a participant in a video trial to “share” what appears on the screen of their computer with other participants. It can be very helpful in that it can ensure that a witness looks at the correct exhibit, or focuses on the relevant portion of an exhibit. But screen-sharing has significant downsides. First, when a participant shares their screen, their screen essentially “takes over” everyone else’s screen, including the judge’s screen. The boxes in which each participant’s face is visible — including that in which the witness appears — reduce in size substantially, which is not ideal. Each user can adjust the size of the shared screen, but this might be beyond many users’ skill sets and could take more time than it’s worth. Second, only the participant sharing their screen can scroll or otherwise navigate through the exhibit.</p><h5>3. Witnesses</h5><p>As with many other aspects of managing video trials and evidentiary hearings, much of the work most critical to ensuring the smooth, efficient presentation of testimony should be done well in advance of trial, and most of that work should focus on the witnesses’ access to and comfort with technology.</p><h6>a. Pre-Trial Considerations</h6><p>The trial scheduling orders used by most judges in our court require counsel/ pro se litigants to meet and confer with their witnesses and each other regarding several topics, including witness preparation. Specific topics for discussion include the following:</p><ul><li>Access to technology:</li><li><ul><li>What equipment will the witness use?</li><li><ul><li>Laptop or other device with internal or external camera and microphone?</li><li>Headset?</li><li>Device screen or separate monitors? How many? (Ideally, the witness will have two screens: one for Zoom; one for viewing exhibits.)</li></ul></li><li>If the witness’s equipment is not adequate, can they participate from counsel’s office in a safe, socially distant fashion and use the (likely) more suitable equipment and (likely) more reliable internet connection? If counsel’s office is not available, can such arrangements be made with a third party, such as a court-reporting service? The downside of situating a witness in the office of a third party is that the third party is not likely to offer support in the event technological problems arise, and even less likely to offer assistance in ensuring that the witness is present when called to testify. And of course, such arrangements could increase the cost of trial. On the other hand, depositions are routinely conducted by video, so the discovery process offers an opportunity to iron out these wrinkles prior to trial.</li></ul></li><li>Comfort with technology:</li><li><ul><li>Does the witness know how to locate, open and navigate through an exhibit?</li><li>Does the witness know how to use whatever platform the court will use to conduct the hearing?</li></ul></li><li>Physical situation:</li><ul><li>Does the witness have access to a space from which they can testify without interruption or intrusion by others? This is a particular concern for pro se litigants and lay witnesses.</li><li>If the witness does not have access to a quiet, private space, can such arrangements be made with counsel, a friendly local law firm, or a third party (such as a court-reporting service)? See above for the advantages and disadvantages of such arrangements.</li></ul></ul><h6>b. Trial Strategies</h6><p>We encourage courts to think hard about ways to streamline trial testimony. Consider, for example, whether certain direct testimony can be introduced via declaration, so long as the declarant is made available during trial for cross-examination. This works well for witnesses whose testimony is devoted to a fairly discrete topic: the value of a residence or of a vehicle, for example. It does not work well for critical percipient witnesses, whose credibility will be very important and whose testimony likely will reach a wide variety of topics.</p><p>Another way to streamline trial testimony is to require counsel/pro se litigants to meet and confer prior to trial as to what facts might be proper subjects for stipulation, or as to what exhibits they might be able to stipulate to authenticity. This could avoid, for example, the need for witness testimony devoted to authenticating bank statements or other business records.</p><p>Many of our colleagues and litigants have asked whether it is more difficult for a judge to assess the credibility of witnesses during a video trial. This question has become common enough that we believe it appropriate to address it directly.</p><p>In our experience, video hearings improve a judge’s ability to assess witness credibility. The judge’s view of a witness during a video hearing is head-on and close up. In a courtroom, the judge often observes the witness from the side and from several feet (if not yards) away. In addition, a witness’s credibility is affected not only by their demeanor; their words matter, too. A witness who answers every question with “I don’t know” or “I don’t recall” likely will lack credibility no matter where or how the court receives the testimony.</p><h6>d. Preventing Problems Before They Happen and Addressing Them When They Occur</h6><p>In any trial, hiccups are inevitable — an that’s part of the fun! Video hearings, however, offer opportunities for speed bumps that would never materialize in live hearings. If a witness is well-prepared, chances are these issues will never arise. But just in case, we offer the following suggestions.</p><p>Consider developing a set of canned witness instructions. These could take the form of an informational outline that the courtroom deputy shares with counsel and witnesses during pre-trial practice sessions or instructions that the judge reads into the record after each witness is sworn in. Regardless of their form, these instructions will set the tone and should remind the witness of the need to answer truthfully; to refrain from looking at any documents or materials other than the exhibits placed in front of them; to testify from a quiet, private place; and to ask questions and request breaks if and when the need arises. If these instructions take the form of an informational outline, they can include guidance on proper attire and how to address the judge, counsel and other parties.</p><Make>sure your record is clear. If something goes awry, make sure to describe it clearly and do what you can to preserve the integrity of your record. For example, if you see (or suspect) that another person is present in the room from which a witness is testifying, stop the examination and question the witness directly about what is going on. If another person is with the witness, instruct them to leave and remind the witness not to let that happen again.</Make><h4>4. Sealing the Record</h4><p>Consistent with § 107 of the Bankruptcy Code and relevant case law,3 courts must take great care to tailor any restrictions on public access to its proceedings as narrowly as possible. But where the parties establish that public access to specific testimony and/or exhibits should be restricted, it falls on the court to figure out how to make that work. Available video-hearing technology does not make it particularly easy to create an evidentiary record that is partly sealed and partly available to the public, but with appropriate staff training, some patience and a little practice, it can be done.</p><p>By the time a case involving evidence that must be sealed comes to trial, the court likely will have become familiar with what that evidence consists of and the issues as to which it is relevant. This means that the court likely will know well in advance what exhibits and/or testimony should be sealed, and court staff can work with the parties to make sure the record is as secure as possible. If trial is taking place on relatively short notice, however, it is critical that the court discuss with the parties whether any evidence should be sealed, so that it can manage those logistics.</p><p>For example, if a trial is completely remote — with no one in the courtroom — the court staff responsible for admitting parties as “Panelists” and “Attendees” will need to take great care to identify who is entitled to remain in the virtual courtroom during sealed proceedings and who should be excluded (such as, for example, third-party witnesses and members of the public). The mechanics of this are too complicated to explain here. But it is somewhat tedious and will take a few extra minutes each time the court toggles between an unrestricted record and one that is sealed. Remember: Patience is a virtue!</p><p>The importance of broaching the possibility of a sealed record as early as possible and in as much detail as possible cannot be overstated. As with many of the issues we have addressed, this kind of advance planning will go a long way toward ensuring a smooth, efficient trial.</p><p>3 See generally In re Crawford, 194 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 1999). Chapter 1</p><h4>5. Decorum</h4><p>In our experience, it is easy for video hearings to slip into a more casual vibe, certainly much more so than in-person hearings ever would. While we encourage our colleagues to allow some leeway in this regard — this pandemic has been incredibly difficult for all of us, which justifies more than a little empathy and forgiveness — we must remember that we preside over proceedings in federal court and we have an obligation to foster respect for the judiciary and the judicial process and to set an example for the lawyers and litigants who appear before us.</p><h3>V. Where We Go from Here</h3><p>We are frequently asked when in-person hearings will resume. The better question is to what extent will remote hearing technology continue to play a role once it is safe to resume in-person hearings.</p><p>The feedback we have received through official and unofficial channels strongly suggests that lawyers and litigants have come to appreciate (if not prefer) the use of video technology to conduct certain routine hearings and other proceedings. They mention hearings on motions requesting relief from the automatic stay, reaffirmation agreements and disclosure statements, as well as status conferences, as proceedings the court should conduct by remote means even after we reopen our courtrooms. Only a slim majority believe that evidentiary hearings should be conducted in person, and only a slightly greater majority believe that trials should be conducted in person.</p><p>Change is hard. But one gift we received from this pandemic is that it forced bankruptcy courts to focus intently and immediately on how we conduct business, both in and out of the courtroom. We have proven ourselves to be resilient and flexible, and we have learned that much of what we do can and likely should be done remotely. Remote-hearing tools yield substantial benefits in terms of savings of time and money, and can substantially improve access to justice for many of our constituents. The disadvantages are few and can be managed, if not eliminated, with some clear instructions and planning.</p><p>While each court will have to determine for itself, its bar and its litigants when it is safe to reopen and to what extent video or other remote hearing technology will continue to play a role, we believe it is likely that most courts will adopt a hybrid approach. Hearings and other proceedings that do not involve testimony or extensive oral argument are likely to continue to convene via remote means. With respect to evidentiary hearings and trials, we see most courts eliminating the use of paper exhibits and permitting video testimony for witnesses offered for a limited purpose or whose personal circumstances (employment or child care concerns; physical ability) make appearing by video a better choice. In the end, we will provide better service to more people if we continue to make good use of the skills and tools we have developed and implemented over the course of this most astonishing year.</p></article></section><section><h2>Chapter 2 The Operations Perspective</h2><article id="chapter2"><section class="authors"><p>Una M. O’Boyle</p><p>Clerk, U.S. Bankruptcy Court District of Delaware</p></section><p>During and after a disaster event, government organizations, including the federal judiciary, have an ethical responsibility to ensure the safety of their employees and to continue operations in a prudent and efficient manner. There are no statutory requirements placed upon the judicial branch regarding continuity of operations planning (COOP). However, the importance of judicial branch continuity planning for the endurance of constitutional government is self-evident. The Judicial Council of the U.S. Courts has long encouraged the development and implementation of business continuity policies and procedures that allow for the continuation of all or most business functions of the courts, and most courts have COOP plans in place. It should surprise no one that the COVID-19 pandemic tested these plans to their core. Fortunately, much of our planning proved very practical and helpful, but certainly weak spots were found.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic took the world by storm, as the timeline below demonstrates. It moved — and changed — so quickly that we were left with almost no time to prepare, and those preparations we managed to cobble together on the fly were sometimes rendered nearly useless overnight.</p><h3>I. COVID-19 Pandemic Timeline</h3><p><strong>December 31, 2019</strong>: Wuhan Municipal Health Commission in China reports cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is eventually identified. January 21, 2020: The first case of COVID-19 is diagnosed in the U.S. January 30, 2020: The World Health Organization declares a public health emergency of international concern.</p><ul><li><strong>February 26, 2020</strong>: The first U.S. case of COVID-19 with no travel history is reported.</li><li><strong>March 13, 2020</strong>: President Trump declares a National Emergency.</li><li><strong>March 17, 2020</strong>: COVID-19 cases are reported in all 50 states.</li><li>The Northern District of California closes four federal courthouses to the public until May 1.</li><li> <ul><li>U.S. states and counties began issuing stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders.</li><li>The CDC recommends that organizations cancel or postpone events of 50 or more people for eight weeks.</li><li>The bankruptcy courts begin issuing orders to limit in-person hearings to emergency matters only, or suspending non-time-sensitive matters for several weeks, or conducting all hearings telephonically.</li></ul></li><li><strong>March 20, 2020</strong>: The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) issues guidance to the courts, including postponing proceedings with more than 10 people and allowing telework as much as possible.</li><li> <ul><li>As March wanes on, courthouses close temporarily after persons in the courts test positive for the novel coronavirus.</li></ul></li><li><strong>March 27, 2020</strong>: President Trump signs the CARES Act into law.</li><li><ul><li>Bankruptcy courts around the country move to adopt temporary rules that will provide relief for consumer debtors and small businesses during the pandemic.</li></ul></li><li><strong>March 31, 2020</strong>: The CDC recommendation is reduced to no more than 10 people at an event.</li><li><strong>April 2020</strong>: Many of the bankruptcy courts close courthouses completely; others issue orders mandating protective masks and social distancing for all visitors and staff in courthouses.</li><li><ul><li>Courts issue orders limiting hand deliveries and extending telephonic-only hearings for another several weeks.</li><li>At the same time, courts begin to outfit courtrooms with plexiglass dividers and social distancing, preparing to return to in-person hearings.</li><li>While courts initially use temporary solutions to conduct virtual hearings, as the weeks go by it becomes apparent that longer-term solutions are required.</li></ul></li><li><strong>September 2020</strong>: It becomes clear that courts must continue to operate partly remotely sine die!</li></ul><h3>II. Court Operations</h3><p>The ability of individual bankruptcy courts to transition quickly to remote operations depended largely on the court’s particular pre-pandemic experience with employee telework and with conducting telephonic hearings. According to the Annual Telework Report for Calendar Year 2018 (the most recent available) published by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC), which includes data on approximately 84% of active employees of the federal judiciary (excluding judges),4 less than half worked remotely on a regular basis:</p><ul><li>42% were reported as recurring teleworkers (telework regularly at least once a pay period)</li><li>56% were reported as ad hoc teleworkers (telework on a situational basis as needed)</li><li>2% were reported as full-time teleworkers (do not regularly report to the employing office at least twice per bi-weekly pay period).</li></ul><p>Bankruptcy courts did slightly better than average, reporting that 65% of their workforce did some remote work. This represents a material increase from the prior year (2017), when just 50% of the bankruptcy courts’ workforce did some type of telework.</p><p>Courts with minimal remote or telework experience faced a variety of challenges:</p><ul> <li>scrambling to research and implement permanent or temporary IT options and solutions;</li><li>acquiring additional equipment (such as smartphones and headphones) and distributing it to staff and judges;</li><li>remotely training staff and judges on how to telework;</li><li>managing issues with staff ’s at-home internet access;</li><li>working with third-party telecommunications vendors to test and implement new services and platforms; and</li><Segments>of the federal judiciary that contributed data to the report included all “court units,” which in turn includes appellate, district and bankruptcy courts, as well as probation, pretrial and federal public defender organizations.</Segments><li>working with the AOUSC to ensure compliance with judiciary guidelines.</li></ul><p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused an enormous spike in demand for remote workplace equipment such as laptops, scanners, printers and softphone licenses. This increase in national demand placed courts in competition with businesses, schools and other organizations, and led to a shortage in necessary equipment and other supplies. Courts struggled to obtain what they needed to continue to operate. Federal procurement regulations posed an additional hurdle, with limits on open-market items and a lack of blanket purchase agreements for certain equipment, such as Microsoft Surface Pro tablets. Courts also had difficulty obtaining masks, hand sanitizer and antibacterial products, just like every other business and household in America.</p><h3>III. Telephonic and Video Hearings</h3><p>Judicial Conference policy generally prohibits the broadcasting of proceedings in federal trial courts.5 In March 2020, however, the Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference approved a temporary exception to this policy. This exception allowed judges to authorize the use of teleconference technology to provide the public and the media audio access to court proceedings while public access to federal courthouses was restricted due to health and safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Although many bankruptcy courts regularly conducted telephonic hearings prior to the pandemic, several did not — and those who did not had to quickly find a solution that would accommodate the manner and volume of their hearings.</p><p>The AOUSC encouraged courts to choose from nationally supported video/ teleconferencing platforms or from commercially available platforms that had been developed specifically to facilitate remote court proceeding, including:</p><ul><li>AT&T Connect/WebEx;</li><li>Cisco Meeting App (CMA);</li><li>Cisco WebEx;</li><li>Jabber Client;</li></ul><ul><li>Microsoft Teams;</li><li>Skype for Business;</li><li>National IP Telephone Service; and</li><li>National Video Teleconferencing Service.</li></ul><p>Courts also looked to other options such as third-party fee-for-service telephonic providers like CourtCall and CourtSolutions, especially when there was a need to accommodate dozens or even hundreds of participants. Although parties were charged for using these services, those vendors also provided free access to pro se litigants, certain trustees and other parties in order to assist the courts. According to one such provider, active users on its system during the COVID-19 pandemic represented a nine-fold increase over pre-pandemic usage.</p><p>Telephonic hearings conducted outside of the courtroom presented a particular challenge to the creation of an official record. </p><p>Typically, courts use an electronic court recording device (ECCRO) located in the courtroom to create the official record. But operation of the ECCRO requires someone to be physically present in the courtroom. Courts solved this problem in a number of different ways, such as by having third-party providers record the proceedings and transmit the audio files to the court for upload to the docket. But that method caused a short delay (24-48 hours) in the availability of the audio from any given hearing, which disappointed many courts and particularly the press, who were accustomed to having almost immediate post-hearing access to the audio record. Through much research, trial and error, courts have since found various solutions to record directly to their systems, such as:</p><ul><li>remote desktop;</li><li>Crestron Xpanel;</li><li>FTR 6.5 Touch;</li><li>Lectrosonic DMTH4; and</li><li>Sangeal Digital Recorder, MP3 Cutter and 2 DCR Converter.</li></ul><h4>A. Legal Concerns with Fees for Telephonic Services</h4><p>Courts utilizing the services of third-party vendors that charged litigants and lawyers a fee to participate in hearings without providing a free alternative, such as being able to walk into the courtroom, were confronted with legal concerns. The fees charged by these vendors are neither authorized by statute nor prescribed by the Judicial Conference under 28 U.S.C. § 1930(b). Although the fees were not being paid to the court, the court theoretically facilitated their collection by not offering a free alternative service. Prior to the pandemic and the shutdown of the courthouses, that free alternative was the public’s ability to attend hearings in person at the courthouse. Faced with these issues, the bankruptcy courts began to search for no-fee alternatives.</p><h4>B. Video Hearings</h4><p>Although many courts had telephonic hearings pre-COVID, almost every court had to scramble to provide a way to hold evidentiary hearings by video so that judges could hear testimony and assess credibility. In addition to the AOUSC-supported solutions, courts looked to third-party solutions, such as Zoom for Government, which initially could accommodate more participants more easily than other solutions. Many judges and staff were also experienced with Zoom, having used it in academic settings.</p><p>Although Zoom was considered the only viable solution for some courts, the AOUSC unfortunately discouraged its use and recommended the nationally supported applications instead.</p><h5>1. Challenges Faced by the Courts with Moving to Virtual Hearings</h5><p>Challenges faced by courts in moving to remote hearings include:</p><ul><li>obtaining technology licenses, such as FedRamp licenses;</li><li>difficulty training judges and staff on new technology remotely;6</li></ul><p>In order to reincorporate the use of courts’ digital recording systems (FTR) into the courts’ daily hearing routines, as well as provide a more convenient option for the public to connect, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court elected to roll out a FedRamp-compliant Zoom solution to all chambers and their respective support staff. The challenge was how to achieve this rollout during a pandemic when everyone was teleworking while still appropriately training necessary personnel. By using Microsoft Teams, the Automation group was able to schedule and conduct one-on-one training sessions through which court staff members were able to walk through the new process completely hands-on under the full observation and tutelage of the automation team. This allowed for ideas and questions to be verbally communicated, remote desktop connections to be clearly viewed, the full starting and stopping of test hearings over Zoom, and even the occasional assistance from moderators as needed. In short, trainees received a start-to-finish environment from which they could obtain a complete picture of the new process, all while maintaining appropriate safety protocols. The court continues to use Microsoft Teams as a method for primary court staff to allow their backup counterparts to observe the process in real time and help maintain their own proficiency with all of the new procedures.</p><ul> <li>Conference phone lines: With everyone in the Judiciary teleworking, there was saturation with the AT&T teleconference phone system, resulting in the AOUSC issuing guidance for courts to stagger their teleconference start times;</li><li>Internet access: With many schools closed and many people in large metropolitan areas trying to telework, slowdowns at local court units and neighborhoods occurred in regions across the country where many people were trying to simultaneously use the same local internet provider; and</li><li>Bandwidth: With everyone in the Judiciary teleworking and using internet connections to get federal judiciary internet access, outbound internet browsing, and significantly, more collaboration technologies with external parties, bandwidth became a major concern. The AOUSC quickly doubled the Judiciary’s internet bandwidth. Even so, with employees and court hearings using videoconferencing daily, services on the Judiciary’s intranet experienced latency or service degradation. Employees were advised to limit the use of videoconferencing to allow court hearings to function as required.</li></ul><h5>2. Technical Issues with Virtual Hearings</h5><p>As the courts embraced new applications, their automation departments struggled to manage and overcome the myriad issues that arose during hearings, including:</p><ul><li>ensuring security;</li><li>controlling entry to the hearing, speaking, muting;</li><li>limitations/issues imposed by private internet connections;</li><li>file transfers and screen-sharing;</li><li>enabling/disabling recording;</li><li>registering participants;</li><li>disabling social features and emojis;</li><li>disabling backgrounds;</li><li>Zoom-bombing; and</li><li>preventing participants from renaming displayed identities.</li></ul><h4>IV. Summary</h4><p>Within the federal judiciary, the bankruptcy courts historically have been the leaders in utilizing new technology to fulfill their mission and compensate for budget and staffing deficits and the nature of bankruptcy case filings. When faced with the many challenges brought on by the onset and continued impact of the pandemic, the bankruptcy courts were able to rise to the occasion and quickly redefine the ways by which they conduct business. Through in-depth, targeted research and a well-defined sense of interagency collaboration, the bankruptcy courts as a whole were able to formulate usable solutions to mitigate this highly unprecedented event. </p><p>With established relationships among sister courts, local federal partners, emergency personnel at the AOUSC, third-party vendors and the bar, the bankruptcy courts were generally able to transition to remote operations with minimal hurdles, keeping the bar and the public informed through telephonic town halls, website updates, tweets and helplines.</p></article></section><section><h2>Chapter 3 The Attorney Perspective</h2><article id="chapter3"><section class="authors"><p>Veronica Brown-Moseley</p><p>Boleman Law Firm, P.C. (Richmond, Va.)</p><p>David J. Richardson BakerHostetler (Los Angeles)</p></section><p>This chapter is written by, and for, practitioners, including debtors and litigants who may appear on their own behalf. For those who have had substantial experience making online appearances, some of this chapter may appear to state the obvious, and certain points addressed below may be similar to points raised in other chapters. But to the extent there is repetition or an obviousness to the issues covered, it should be kept in mind that this is a result of the seriousness of the point. And it may be a point that would otherwise be missed entirely by an attorney making few online appearances. Online appearances offer risks and pitfalls even for those who may believe that they have the software mastered. The recent “I am not a cat” viral video demonstrates how important it is to understand platform features that an attorney might never use, such as an animal face filter.</p><p>Online court appearances might not be mandatory for much longer, but the pandemic has changed forever how we appear in court. Video appearances may remain an option in most if not all federal courts, even after any sense of “normalcy” returns. Rather than treat online appearances as a temporary annoyance, make the most of this new “normal” by ensuring that you are prepared for a problem-free and effective appearance.</p><h3>I. How to Make an Effective Appearance on Zoom or Any Other Video Program</h3><p>Judges have seen everything by now. However, that doesn’t mean that your argument won’t be undermined by a messy background, inappropriate attire, or family members interrupting your argument to ask where they can find the car keys. Unlike the podium in a courtroom, your podium at home is entirely of your own creation, and it requires some forethought so that it doesn’t accidentally weaken the strength of your presentation.</p><p>Not a hair out of place. Before you make an appearance, check how you will appear in your camera. If you have a Zoom account, you can start a meeting on your own at any time by logging in to your account and seeing how you appear on camera. If not, you can check the image before you press the button to join the session with video, and make any last-minute adjustments.</p><ul> <li>Start with your background. Consider avoiding the computerized background that allows you to add vacation photos or a firm logo. The software will usually blur the outline of your own image, causing hands to appear and disappear from the background, or parts of your head to disappear as you move. No judge is going to admit that this might affect how they consider your argument, but it can be distracting, and it won’t help you appear professional.</li><li>Check what’s behind you. If you don’t use a software background, what’s visible behind you? A framed photo from an old Spring Break trip that you’ve never shown your mother? A stack of fan fiction romances about Star Trek characters? Dishes from the meals you’ve been eating at your computer? Computers are moveable, and backgrounds can be adjusted by moving your chair or camera. Make sure that you have a simple and professional view behind you.</li><li>Lighting. It matters. Make sure that your background isn’t a large, bright window that will leave you in silhouette. Or that a window beside you doesn’t leave you washed out by the brightness. Close the blinds. Turn on a lamp. Create lighting that won’t be distracting.</li><li>Dress for the occasion. Presume that your judge is continuing to run a professional court, and that the usual dress code applies. It’s likely that many people reading this book have, at least once, appeared in court online while wearing shorts or pajamas from the waist down. While it’s an understandable temptation, be careful about the risk. You might have to stand up at an unexpected moment to prevent the cat from knocking over your screen, or after spilling coffee in your lap, so it’s better to be safe than sorry.</li><li>Upgrade your Wi-Fi. If your internet service is a few years old, there’s a good chance that your video and audio may be affected by disturbances in the signal. Perhaps your screen will freeze for a moment. Or your audio may simply disappear briefly. It’s a common issue in any hearing that involves a large number of attorneys. Don’t simply presume that your phone is good enough, and hope for the best. Online appearances will be a common occurrence for the rest of your career. Invest in fast internet for your home.</li><li>Upgrade your computer. Laptops are convenient, as are iPads. But a large screen with a quality camera is a critical requirement for an effective online presentation. There may be many hearings where you don’t need to see any other participant on a screen larger than the palm of your hand. However, it always helps to see the judge’s face, his or her expressions as you speak, and any subtle clues that should guide your presentation. Even more importantly, a large screen — or two of them — are critical for an evidentiary hearing (discussed below) for dealing with documents and shared screens. If you can help it, avoid appearing on your mobile phone, especially if you’re holding it in your hand. If you must appear on your phone, fix it in place, on a stand if possible, so that your camera isn’t moving about.</li><li>Turn off notifications. If you’re on a computer or device that makes a sound every time you receive an email or a text, turn it off, or close the email program until your appearance is over. Aside from being a distraction while you speak, it suggests that you couldn’t be bothered to make the effort to present a professional argument.</li><li>Learn the program. While Zoom.gov is becoming the most common platform for federal courts to use for online appearances, it isn’t the only program, and some state courts are using other platforms. Make sure you understand the basics of the program that will be used for your hearing so that you don’t have to be instructed on its use by the judge during the hearing. Know where the “mute” button is, and how to un-mute your microphone when it’s time to speak. Understand how to quickly make your video feed go blank, just in case a family member picks an inopportune time to enter the room in their pajamas. Know how to “raise your hand” or other feature to inform the court that you wish to be heard. Learn about the various view options so that you can decide whether you want to view all participants or just focus on the speaker. Know how to set up your own appearance screen so that your professional name appears on the bottom of the screen (along with any requirements the court might have, such as the case or docket number for your appearance), and not an old college nickname, or the name used by one of your children for schooling from home. These are the most basic functions, but the more you know about the program, the fewer pitfalls might await. There are many tutorials available online and many can be found on some bankruptcy courts’ websites, including some geared toward pro se debtors or litigants.</li><li>Know the judge’s requirements. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the court might have a local rule governing how you appear on screen, such as requiring that your screen identify you by name and perhaps by docket or case number, or by client. Check the judge’s or court’s procedures for online appearances (see Exhibit F) to ensure that your appearance won’t violate rules that the judge expects you to follow.</li><li>Lock the door. An interfering pet can be fun in a Zoom call with friends, but a cat’s tail waving across the screen as it walks across your keyboard, or children fighting over the TV remote, are distractions that will weaken your presentation. Lock the door if you can. They’ll be just fine until the hearing is over.</li><li>How did it go? When it’s all over, consider listening to how you sounded. Some courts are putting audio files of the hearings directly on the docket. If you have the opportunity, and if you can stand hearing your own voice, listen, and be constructively critical. How often do you say “uh” and “um”? Are you overly combative with the judge? Did you make your point or get lost in the weeds? Colleagues can only tell us so much about how our argument actually went. Listening to yourself can teach you far more.</li></ul><h3>II. Prepare for Disaster</h3><p>Anything can go wrong during an online appearance, but there are a few possibilities that are more likely than most.</p><ul><li>Power or Internet outage. Despite every discouragement stated earlier about using a mobile phone for your appearance, have it handy. Have it fully charged. Have the link for your court appearance available on the phone. And be prepared to log in on your phone just in case the power goes out or your internet service goes down.</li><li>Plan around neighborhood noise. My neighbor’s gardening service shows up on a regular schedule — every time I’m about to make an online appearance. I don’t know how they know in advance, but it happens almost every time. Consider whether the location for your appearance is vulnerable to nearby leaf blowers, police helicopters, sirens and other disruptions that might affect your presentation, and if possible, locate yourself in a room with fewer distractions.</li><li>Know about filters. We’ve all seen the cat video. We all know the risk. Learn about your program’s filters and other options, at least enough to know how to recognize them and turn them off.</li><li>Actual disaster. It can’t hurt to have a colleague or co-counsel ready to appear at the last minute, particularly if it’s an important hearing. I was recently preparing to log on to a hearing to make an argument when I looked up and saw my neighbor’s shed and trees on fire. It was a hot, dry and windy summer day in California, which meant that this was an emergency far more important than appearing in court. Luckily, co-counsel was ready to jump in despite the lack of a pro hac vice order yet granted, and the fire was put out without doing any major damage to the neighborhood. But being prepared meant that our client was represented at the hearing.</li></ul><h3>III. How to Make an Effective Telephonic Appearance</h3><p>Whether you’re appearing at a hearing that is being held telephonically or have reason to appear telephonically for a hearing that is otherwise conducted on video, there are a few considerations that might help you present effectively.</p><ul><li>Can you hear me now? Courts are moving away from their requirement that any telephonic appearances be made on landlines, perhaps recognizing that few attorneys were actually following the rule. But if you are going to appear by mobile phone, don’t adopt the attitude that the number of visible bars on your phone is beyond your control. The judge might commiserate with your poor phone service, but it won’t help you present your argument if you are cutting in and out during the call. It also will be another indication that you couldn’t be bothered to prepare. Make the call from somewhere that has a strong enough signal to ensure a consistent connection.</li><li>Handsfree? It can be awkward to hold a phone to your ear during a call, but some courts forbid the use of your speakerphone or even external microphones. Check the court’s rules for telephonic appearances, and try to follow them.</li><li>Test your microphone. Ear buds with a built-in microphone are becoming a common method for telephonic appearances. However, make sure that the quality of your microphone is not undermining your presentation.</li><li>Keep your charger handy. This one is self-explanatory. Don’t risk a dying battery and a missing charger.</li><li>Pause and breathe. Some telephonic connections prevent you from hearing others on the call while you are speaking. We’ve all been on those calls where participants talk over one another, then pause for a lengthy period waiting for the other to re-state their comment, then jump back in at the same time to talk over one another again. Don’t let that be your style in court, especially if the other party speaking is the judge. Pay attention to the connection you have on your phone. If it appears that there is any risk that you can’t hear the judge as you’re droning on about a case that was decided back in Elizabethan times that is somehow relevant to your motion, make sure you pause occasionally, at least long enough that you’ll be able to tell whether the judge is trying to be heard. The judge just might be trying to say something you really need to hear.</li><li>Are you appearing pro se? Many pro se litigants will benefit from increased online hearings, but it will also be an entirely new experience for most. Pro se litigants should check the court’s website to see whether it has specific information to assist them with appearances.</li></ul><h3>IV. Issues for an Online Trial or Evidentiary Hearing</h3><p>Online evidentiary hearings and trials are likely to continue for some time beyond the publication of this book and may become more common even once in-person hearings resume — at least for those participants, attorneys or witnesses who wish to avoid long-distance travel.</p><p>Some of the issues described below are expansions of issues described above (i.e., know your online program), but are focused on the evidentiary setting.</p><ul> <li>Know your program. Presenting evidence in a form that can be shared with all counsel and viewed by the court is one of the challenges that has had to be addressed for online hearings. It is typically done through screen-sharing, using exhibits already uploaded to the court and shared with counsel. Become comfortable with the program’s options before engaging in an evidentiary hearing or trial to ensure that you and/or your colleague will be able and prepared to share their screen to put the evidence before the court.</li><li>Prepare your witness for the online experience. A successful evidentiary hearing requires more than your own appearance. Make sure your witness understands everything written in the prior section describing a successful online appearance. A witness’s credibility might not hinge on their Zoom background, the lack of screaming children or lunch-stained t-shirt they’re wearing, but it’s best to cover this ground before the hearing begins. Set up a practice Zoom session with your witness to make sure that their preparation for the hearing is done on the same program, with the same settings and view options, so that your witness isn’t struggling to view an exhibit for the first time at the hearing.</li><li>Know the court’s rules. Local rules, including COVID-specific procedural orders and the judge’s own courtroom rules, may cover issues for presenting evidence and examining of witnesses during an online hearing. For example, the court might require that your witness be alone in the room where they are appearing to ensure that they are not being coached or distracted.</li></ul><h3>V. Managing Clients in Remote Court Hearings</h3><p>When a client’s attendance is required at a remote court hearing, it is essential for an attorney to take the necessarily actions to adequately prepare the client, keep the client informed throughout the process, and be prepared to address technical and other issues that may arise.</p><ul> <li>Develop and implement remote court hearing procedures. The procedures that were previously adequate to manage clients during in-person court hearings might no longer be sufficient to address issues that arise in remote court hearings. Formalized procedures designed to prevent potential pitfalls and other mishaps help to ensure a high level of client service and effective remote court appearances on a consistent basis. All attorneys in a firm who will make remote court appearances should be properly trained on the remote court hearing procedures. Additionally, the procedures should be regularly evaluated and adjusted as needed.</li><li>Verify identity. Ensure that clients are able to provide acceptable forms of identification prior to remote court hearings, and have access to a client’s proof of identity at the time of the hearing. Also, be familiar with the jurisdictional requirements for verification of a client’s identity prior to the remote court hearing, and be prepared to comply. For example, if a jurisdiction permits an attorney to provide a declaration confirming verification of a client’s identity prior to the hearing, rather than at the time of the hearing, an attorney should take the necessary action to verify the client’s identity and submit the required information in advance of the hearing as opposed to causing a delay during the hearing for verification of identity.</li><li>Client attendance requirements. Be familiar with the court’s client attendance requirements for remote court hearings. At some hearings, counsel might be required to attend, but client attendance is not required. In instances that a client’s attendance is not required, be sure to communicate this information to the client in advance. For example, the court mails notices to clients of confirmation hearing dates and times in chapter 13 cases. However, in many instances, client attendance at a confirmation hearing is not required, so it is important that the client is made aware that his attendance is not required to prevent the client from unnecessarily taking time off work or showing up at the court on the scheduled date and time. Similarly, if a client’s attendance is required at a remote court hearing, it is important to make the client aware of the attendance requirement in advance. It may be helpful to provide a client with multiple forms of notice, such as a reminder at an appointment, a follow-up telephone call, a letter by mail and an email communication. More notice is certainly better than less notice; the ultimate goal is the client’s attendance at the hearing. Providing multiple notices to the client helps to improve the chances of attendance, emphasizes to the client the importance of attendance, and assists the client with taking the necessary action (such as scheduling time off work) to be prepared to attend on the scheduled date and time.</li><li>Client access to a remote court hearing. Well in advance of a remote court hearing, an attorney should notify the client of the manner in which the court hearing will be conducted (telephonic or virtual), the date and time of the scheduled court hearing, and the approximate amount of time the client should be prepared to spend at the hearing. Ensure that the client has access to all of the tools necessary to participate in the remote hearing, such as access to a computer, laptop or smartphone, access to reliable internet service, or access to an operating telephone. Work to identify clients who may experience access issues ahead of time (such as a client who experienced difficulty completing the virtual consultation at the time of the case filing), and work with those clients to develop appropriate courses of action. Creativity and going the extra mile to support the client will give rise to the best outcomes. This may include, but certainly is not limited to, the following:</li><li><ul><li>sending clients written instructions on how to install the Zoom application;</li><li>spending extra time with a client to help him or her successfully install the Zoom application;</li><li>conducting a practice hearing with the client in advance;</li><li>seeking permission from the court for a client to appear telephonically in an instance where a virtual appearance is impracticable for the client; and</li><li>providing a client with access to the necessary tools to appear at a remote court hearing, such as access to a telephone, computer or internet service at the attorney’s office.</li></ul></li><li>Prepare client for a remote hearing. Communicate with your client ahead of time regarding what to expect at a remote court hearing. Ensure that the client has access to all information that may be needed, such as copies of the Schedules or other documents filed in the case, proof of identity, questionnaires, interrogatories or other relevant information. Explain to the client that his testimony will be given under oath under the penalty of perjury and what that means. Explain to the client that his or her hearing is not likely to be the only hearing scheduled for a particular date and time, and the importance of remaining quiet until his or her case is called. Encourage the client to be stationary during the hearing, such as not driving, working or walking his dog. Emphasize the importance of minimizing background noises, such as children, pets, notifications from devices and other distractions. Ensure that the client is familiar with how to use the telephonic or virtual conferencing application prior to the hearing, such as how to mute and un-mute, how to turn the camera on and off, and how to enter and exit the application. Remind the client to charge the device that will be used for the hearing prior to the hearing.</li><li>Be prepared for client issues. Always have someone on standby to assist in the event that a client experiences technical or other issues at the time of a remote court hearing. In consumer cases, it is common for an attorney to be responsible for representing multiple clients who are scheduled for remote hearings on the same date and time, such as in § 341 meetings of creditors and court dockets for contested matters. In the event that a client has not logged in on time, it is important to have someone ready to reach out to the client and assist him or her with logging in or to communicate to the attorney regarding the client’s status (i.e., unable to reach the client, the client is unable to attend, the client is experiencing technical difficulties, etc.). The attorney appearing at the remote court hearing will then be able to communicate such information to the court, trustee or other parties when appropriate.</li><li>Check in with the client prior to a remote hearing. Always strive to communicate with the client immediately prior to a remote hearing. Make necessary provisions based on the type of remote hearing as well as the client’s needs. For example, this may involve a phone call or videoconference 30 minutes prior to the remote hearing to review what to expect, answer any last-minute questions or address any issues that the client may have, and to provide comfort and reassurance to a client who may be experiencing high levels of stress related to the remote court appearance. This may also provide an attorney with the opportunity to resolve last-minute technical issues that the client may be experiencing.</li><li>Follow up with the client following a remote court hearing. Always strive to communicate with the client immediately following a remote hearing, and bee sure to disconnect from the remote hearing program prior to such communications. This is an important opportunity to communicate with your client to answer any questions the client may have, address follow-up or other issues related to the hearing, discuss expectations and obligations moving forward, and ensure that the client is fully informed regarding the next steps.</li></ul><h3>VI. Jumping Ethical Hurdles in Remote Court Operations</h3><p>The practice of law has changed drastically and rapidly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In courts across the country, remote court hearings have become the new normal, and reliance upon technology is at an all-time high. Despite unprecedented and swift transformations, an attorney’s ethical obligations pursuant to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct remain the same.7 We will highlight ethical challenges that may arise in remote court operations and provide guidance to assist practitioners in jumping those ethical hurdles.</p><h4>A. Heightened Bar for Competence, Diligence and Communication</h4><The>duties of competence, diligence and communication are at the core of an attorney’s obligations in representing a client in any matter. Compliance with Model Rules 1.1, 1.3, and 1.4 may require lawyers to go the extra mile when representing clients in remote court hearings.</The><section class="model-rules"><h5>Model Rule 1.1: Competence</h5><p>A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</p><h5>Model Rule 1.3: Diligence</h5><p> A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</p><p>7 This chapter will reference the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct as amended by the ABA House of Delegates through August 2020. An attorney should consult the professional rules, ethics opinions and laws of the applicable jurisdiction.</p><h5>Model Rule 1.4: Communications </h5><ul><li>A lawyer shall:</li><li><ol><li>promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client’s informed consent, as defined in Rule 1.0(e), is required by these Rules;</li><li>reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the client’s objectives are to be accomplished;</li><li>keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter;</li><li>promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and</li><li> <p>consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer’s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.</p><ul><li>A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</li></ul></li></ol></li></ul></section><ul><li>Stay abreast of changes in court operations. In an effort to ensure continuous, safe and efficient court operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, many courts have developed and implemented numerous procedures, orders and rules. As developments and changes occur, it is essential for an attorney to remain up to speed and knowledgeable of the new or altered court requirements. Attorneys should pay close attention to updated information on the court’s website and notices from the court to practitioners. Additionally, continuing legal education courses, bar association programming, and legal publications relevant to an attorney’s area of practice can also serve as great sources of information. Maintaining competency in the representation of clients requires attorneys to quickly adapt to evolving practices and procedures, even in the midst of a pandemic.</li><li>Technological competence. As a result of the transition to remote court hearings, an attorney’s ability to competently represent a client in a court appearance now relies heavily upon an attorney’s proficiency in various technical applications and software. A lack of technical proficiency can negatively impact client representation and case outcomes, as well as run afoul of an attorney’s ethical obligation of competency. In advance of a remote court appearance, an attorney should identify all applications and software that will be utilized in the hearing and take appropriate actions to become knowledgeable about such use. This could include, but is not limited to, learning from tutorials, reviewing user manuals and other relevant materials, and seeking the guidance of others.</li><li>Technological support. Competent and diligent representation of a client at a remote court hearing might involve providing some level of technical support to the client. At a minimum, an attorney should adequately prepare a client for a remote hearing, such as ensuring that the client is provided the information needed to log in to the software that will be used at the hearing. However, in instances where a client experiences difficulties with the use of technology, adequate preparation for a remote hearing may involve more, such as ensuring that the client has the ability to participate in the appearance, providing more specific instructions or guidance related to the application or software to be used, or troubleshooting an issue that a client may experience with logging into or participating in an appearance. The extent to which an attorney may need to provide technical support to comply with ethical obligations will vary depending on the circumstances of the case and will be based on a reasonableness standard as indicated in the language of Model Rules 1.1 and 1.3. An attorney should determine what technical support, if any, he or she needs to be prepared to provide to clients in remote court hearings, and develop a procedure to ensure that such support is consistently available.</li><li>Keep the client informed. Communication with a client in the world of remote court hearings presents challenges that might not have been encountered in traditional in-person court appearances. Most obvious is the inability to have confidential discussions with a client at the time of a remote court hearing. This limitation increases the importance of advance preparation and effective communication ahead of time. An attorney should be sure to inform clients of all information relevant to the appearance in advance of the hearing. This may include, but is not limited to, ensuring that the client is informed about the manner in which the hearing will be conducted, ensuring that the client has access to all documentation that will be needed at the hearing, such as identification and copies of documents filed in the case, and ensuring that the client is aware of limitations on his or her ability to communicate directly with counsel at the time of the hearing.</li></ul><h4>B. Confidentiality in the Midst of Technological Revolution</h4><p>Actions that an attorney might need to take to comply with the confidentiality requirements of Model Rule 1.6 in a court hearing have become more complicated as a result of the transition to remote court practice. In particular, more precautions are needed to prevent inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of or access to confidential client information when court hearings are being conducted in a variety of locations outside of the court building, including work offices, homes and other locations.</p><section class="model-rules"><h5>Model Rule 1.6: Confidentiality of Information</h5><ol><li>A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation or the disclosure is permitted by paragraph (b).</li><li>A lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:</li></ol></section><ol> <li>to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm;</li><li>to prevent the client from committing a crime or fraud that is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another and in furtherance of which the client has used or is using the lawyer’s services;</li><li>to prevent, mitigate or rectify substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another that is reasonably certain to result in or has resulted from the client’s commission of a crime or fraud in furtherance of which the client has used the lawyer’s services;</li><li>to secure legal advice about the lawyer’s compliance with these Rules;</li><li>to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client, to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer’s representation of the client;</li><li>to comply with other law or a court order; or</li><li> <p>to detect and resolve conflicts of interest arising from the lawyer’s change of employment or from changes in the composition or ownership of a firm, but only if the revealed information would not compromise the attorney/client privilege or otherwise prejudice the client.</p><ul><li>A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information relating to the representation of a client.</li></ul></li><li>Conduct remote court appearances in private. An attorney is required to take reasonable steps to protect confidential client information. When making a remote court appearance, an attorney should seek to conduct the hearing in a private location. An attorney should take reasonable action to ensure that information presented at a remote hearing is not overhead or witnessed by anyone who is not assisting with the representation, including members of the attorney’s household or other third parties.</li><li>Devices with listening capabilities. Disabling devices with listening capabilities, such as virtual assistants and smart speakers, when an attorney is conducting a remote court hearing can help to minimize the risk of inadvertently exposing confidential information to unauthorized third parties.</li><li>Hardware devices and software systems. In an effort to protect confidential client information during a remote court hearing, an attorney should take reasonable actions to prevent unauthorized access to information on the device being used in the remote hearing. This may include, but is not limited to, installing security-related updates, maintaining antivirus software and using strong passwords. Additionally, reasonable precautions should be taken when connecting to remote hearings over Wi-Fi, such as using a secure network or a virtual private network (VPN).</li></ol><h3>VII. Considerations for Future Court Operations</h3><p>The current need for remote court hearings to promote health and safety, as well as mitigate the spread of COVID-19, might not exist in the future. However, the insights gained as a result of the transition to remote court hearings should be considered in determining the future of court operations.</p><h3>A. Benefits of Remote Court Operations in Consumer Cases</h3><p>Remote court hearings help to promote access to the judicial system for consumer debtors by mitigating or eliminating many of the burdens associated with in-person court appearances. Consumer debtors are commonly among the most economically vulnerable members of our society. In-person court appearances can create additional financial hardship in many instances. Debtors who have unstable employment or recently began new employment could jeopardize their employment by taking time off work to attend in-person court hearings. Time off work can also reduce the income of hourly workers or those without paid leave time available. Additionally, there may be costs associated with travel to attend court hearings, such as public transportation costs, gas costs and parking costs. Remote court appearances reduce, and in some instances eliminate, the burdens of in-person court hearings placed on debtors related to seeking time off work, jeopardizing employment, suffering a loss of income and encountering transportation costs.</p><h4>B. Benefits of Remote Court Operations in Commercial Cases</h4><p>Through the use of remote court hearings, courts will be better able to hold hearings on an emergency basis, including evidentiary hearings, without needing to allow time for cross-country travel. Additionally, debtors and creditors may be able to reduce expenses by reducing attorney travel costs and travel time.</p><h4>C. Pro Se Debtors and Litigants</h4><p>Pro se debtors and litigants are likely to experience the above-referenced benefits associated with remote court operations. However, they may experience challenges related to access to the technology required for the appearance, navigating the technology used, and complying with procedural requirements. These challenges may be overcome by resources made available to the public on the court’s website, through the clerk’s office, and via the efforts of the bankruptcy bar.</p><h4>D. Plan for the Future</h4><p>An attorney in the 2020s needs good tech equipment more than a good wardrobe, such as a large monitor rather than a laptop screen, a good camera, highspeed internet, updated software, multiple screens and a professional setting.</p></article></section></main></body>
